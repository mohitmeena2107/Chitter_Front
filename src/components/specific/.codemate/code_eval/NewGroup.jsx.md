# Code Review Report for `NewGroup` Component

Below is a critical review of your code, highlighting:
- **Industry standards issues**
- **Potential errors and bugs**
- **Unoptimized implementations**
- **Suggested corrections (pseudocode-level) for your reference**

---

## 1. Hardcoded Comparison Number for `selectedMembers`

### Issue:
- The check for `selectedMembers.length < 2` with the error message _"Please Select Atleast 3 Members"_ is inconsistent and misleading; this would allow creation with only 2 members selected (`2 < 2` is false). If at least 3 members are required, the check should be `< 3`.

#### Current Code
```js
if (selectedMembers.length < 2)
  return toast.error("Please Select Atleast 3 Members");
```

#### Suggested Correction
```pseudo
if (selectedMembers.length < 3)
  return toast.error("Please select at least 3 members");
```

---

## 2. Use of `useAsyncMutation` with Mutation Hook

### Issue:
- It's generally recommended to use mutation hooks as returned by RTK Query rather than wrapping hooks with potential custom hooks like `useAsyncMutation` unless thoroughly documented.
- `useAsyncMutation` here receives a hook (not a function), which raises concerns about misuse and clarity.

#### Current Code
```js
const [newGroup, isLoadingNewGroup] = useAsyncMutation(useNewGroupMutation);
```

#### Suggested Correction
- If `useAsyncMutation` expects the result of a mutation hook, it should be:
```pseudo
const [createGroup, isLoadingNewGroup] = useAsyncMutation(useNewGroupMutation());
```
- If `useAsyncMutation` is not necessary, use RTK’s recommended API directly:
```pseudo
const [createGroup, { isLoading: isLoadingNewGroup }] = useNewGroupMutation();
```
*(Use as appropriate for your custom hook implementation.)*

## 3. Incorrect Pattern for Async Calls and Immediate Dialog Closure

### Issue:
- After calling `newGroup`, you immediately call `closeHandler()`. If the mutation fails, the dialog will be closed before error state is handled/shown.

#### Current Code
```js
newGroup("Creating New Group...", {
  name: groupName.value,
  members: selectedMembers,
});

closeHandler();
```

#### Suggested Correction
```pseudo
await newGroup({ name: groupName.value, members: selectedMembers });
// Check for error/success, then close dialog if successful
if (!error) closeHandler();
```
- Add `async` keyword to `submitHandler` function.

---

## 4. Use of `sampleUsers` Import (Unused Variable)

### Issue:
- `sampleUsers` is imported but not used in the component.

#### Current Code
```js
import { sampleUsers } from "../../constants/sampleData";
```

#### Suggested Correction
```pseudo
// Remove unused import
```

---

## 5. Error Handling Pattern for useErrors

### Issue:
- The errors array structure seems overengineered for one error source. If there’s only one error, pass it directly or construct the array only for dynamic multi-error needs.

#### Current Code
```js
const errors = [
  {
    isError,
    error,
  },
];

useErrors(errors);
```

#### Suggested Correction
```pseudo
// If only one error source:
useErrors({ isError, error });

// If multiple, ensure consistent structure throughout the app
```

---

## 6. `key` Prop Usage in List Render

### Issue:
- Should always use a unique and stable identifier for the `key` prop. `_id` is correct if it's unique in your data.

#### Good Practice Confirmed
```js
key={i._id}
```

---

## 7. Consistency in Typography/Text

### Issue:
- Error messages have inconsistent casing/spelling ("Atleast" → "at least").

#### Current Code
```js
return toast.error("Please Select Atleast 3 Members");
```

#### Suggested Correction
```pseudo
return toast.error("Please select at least 3 members");
```

---

## 8. Type for `selectedMembers` State

### Issue:
- If `_id` is a string, consider specifying the generic type in `useState<string[]>([])` for clarity (if using TypeScript).

#### Suggested Correction
```pseudo
const [selectedMembers, setSelectedMembers] = useState<string[]>([]);
```

---

## Summary Table

| Issue | Severity | Correction (Pseudocode) |
|-------|----------|------------------------|
| Wrong members check | **High** | `if (selectedMembers.length < 3)` |
| Unoptimized mutation hook usage | Medium | Use `useNewGroupMutation()` directly |
| Async call—Dialog closes too soon | **High** | `await newGroup(...); if(!error) closeHandler();` |
| Unused import | Low | Remove `sampleUsers` import |
| Error structure overkill | Low | Pass error object directly |
| Error message casing | Low | "at least 3 members" |

---

## Final Notes

- **Async/Await:** Always handle async logic cleanly with feedback to the user before closing dialogs.
- **Error Handling:** Consistency is important if you expand to multiple error sources/components.
- **Dead Code:** Remove unused imports for maintainability.

**Implement the above corrections to improve this component to industry standards.**
