# Security Vulnerabilities Report

## Scope

This report reviews the provided React/Chart.js code for security vulnerabilities **only**, focusing on possible risks related to:
- Input handling
- Data rendering
- Dependency usage

---

## Code Summary

- Renders two charts (Line, Doughnut) using Chart.js via react-chartjs-2.
- Accepts and uses dynamic data and labels (`value` and `labels` props).
- Imports color constants and a data utility from local modules.
- No direct DOM manipulation; rendering is handled by React and Chart.js.

---

## Potential Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. **Untrusted Data Input**
#### Risk
Both `LineChart` and `DoughnutChart` accept `value` and (for DoughnutChart) `labels` props, which populate `data.labels` and `data.datasets`.

If these props come from untrusted sources (e.g., user input, external APIs), there is a minor risk of data-based attacksâ€”such as:

- **DoS (Denial of Service) via resource exhaustion**: User might provide very large arrays, leading to rendering performance problems, or even browser crashes.
- **Invisible/Non-rendering Data**: Unusual data (empty labels, extreme values, etc.) could cause unexpected behavior, but not direct security compromise, unless plugin configurations are insecure.

#### Recommendation
- **Sanitize and Limit Input Data:** Validate the length and type of `value` and `labels` before passing to the chart components.
- **Strict PropTypes/Types:** If using TypeScript/PropTypes, declare types and add default values with limits.

### 2. **Dependency Risks**
#### Risk
- `chart.js` and `react-chartjs-2` must be kept up-to-date, as they occasionally patch vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS issues when rendering HTML in tooltips).
- If custom tooltip templates are ever enabled/settings changed in future updates, risks may increase.

#### Recommendation
- **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Monitor Chart.js advisories. At present (as of 2024-06), the approach here (no custom tooltip callbacks, no raw HTML) is safe.

### 3. **Labels Content and XSS**
#### Risk
- **Low:** Chart.js, by default, does **not render raw HTML** from labels, which means passing untrusted strings in `labels` does **not** introduce XSS unless tooltip or legend callbacks explicitly inject HTML.
- *However*, if Chart.js configuration changes to allow HTML or callbacks return raw HTML, XSS could occur.

#### Recommendation
- **Do not enable HTML in labels or tooltips.**
- If customization is needed, sanitize all labels/content before rendering, or escape potentially dangerous characters.

### 4. **React Dangerous HTML Render**
#### Risk
- This code does **not** use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, thus no direct React-side XSS vector present.

## Summary Table

| Vulnerability    | Description                                                  | Severity | Recommendation                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------|
| Untrusted Data   | Large/unexpected arrays in `value`, `labels` prop           | Low      | Sanitize/limit data           |
| Dependency Risk  | Potential vulnerabilities in Chart.js/react-chartjs-2       | Low      | Keep dependencies updated     |
| Labels Handling  | XSS if Chart.js parses HTML (not default, but config risk)  | Low      | Don't enable HTML tooltips    |
| React HTML Risk  | Use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (not present)              | N/A      | Not applicable                |

---

## Final Recommendations

- **Validate all user/source data** before passing to charts.
- **Limit data size** to avoid DoS.
- **Keep all dependencies updated** to patch discovered vulnerabilities.
- **Do not use custom HTML in tooltips or labels** unless sanitized.
- **Monitor configuration changes** if you or other developers later modify tooltip logic.

---

## Conclusion

**No direct critical security vulnerabilities** were found in the provided code **under current configuration**. Risks may arise if project requirements (inputs, dependency versions, tooltip configurations) change in the future.

---

**If you expose these charts to untrusted data sources, add strict validation and continue to review dependencies for security advisories.**
