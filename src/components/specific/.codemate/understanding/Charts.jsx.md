# Chart Components Module Documentation

## Overview
This module provides two reusable React components for data visualization using Chart.js via the `react-chartjs-2` wrapper:

- **LineChart**: Displays a line chart with customizable data points over the last 7 days.
- **DoughnutChart**: Displays a stylized doughnut chart with customizable values and labels.

Both components are styled with custom colors and are primarily used to visualize metrics like message counts or proportions within a dashboard or analytics context.

---

## Dependencies

- **chart.js**: Core charting functionality and chart types.
- **react-chartjs-2**: React wrapper for easy Chart.js integration.
- **color constants**: Imported from a local constants file.
- **getLast7Days**: Utility function for dynamic labels for the past 7 days.

---

## Components

### 1. LineChart

**Props:**
- `value` (array): Dataset values for the last 7 days. Defaults to an empty array.

**Features:**
- Uses the "Line" chart type.
- Displays data points for the last 7 days (labels auto-generated by `getLast7Days`).
- Custom purple color for the line and fill.
- Legend and title are hidden for a clean look.
- Axis grid lines are hidden.
- Chart automatically starts the y-axis at zero.

---

### 2. DoughnutChart

**Props:**
- `value` (array): Dataset values for the doughnut chart. Defaults to an empty array.
- `labels` (array): Text labels for each data segment. Defaults to an empty array.

**Features:**
- Uses the "Doughnut" chart type.
- Custom purple and orange colors for segments and their hover states.
- Legend is hidden, and there's a large central cutout for a modern look.
- Chart appearance customized with increased cutout size and border colors.

---

## Configuration and Styling

- Chart.js elements and plugins are registered with ChartJS (as required for modular Chart.js imports).
- Styling (fill color, borders, hover effects) is managed via color constants for consistency with the broader UI theme.
- Both charts are responsive.

---

## Exports

- `DoughnutChart`
- `LineChart`

These can be imported and used in any React component to display interactive and styled chart visualizations.

---

## Example Usage

```jsx
import { LineChart, DoughnutChart } from './path/to/chart-module';

<LineChart value={[12, 19, 3, 5, 2, 3, 7]} />
<DoughnutChart value={[60, 40]} labels={['Sent', 'Received']} />
```

---

## Notes

- To modify chart appearance (such as colors), adjust values in `color.js`.
- Ensure the helper utility `getLast7Days()` and color constants are properly implemented/imported.
- Legend and other chart UI elements are hidden by default but can be customized via the options object.
